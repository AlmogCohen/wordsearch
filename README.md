## About

This is a wordsearch game I made with AngularJS. I originally made it for the [Professor P website](http://professorp.co.uk/games/wordsearch/). You can see the original source code in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/davidxmoody/professorp.co.uk). 

This repository extracts the source code from the rest of the Professor P website and introduces a new webpack build script. It can also be run standalone in an iframe:

```html
<iframe src="https://davidxmoody.com/wordsearch/"></iframe>
```

You can customise the words to display as well as the size of the grid and maximum number of words to place in the grid by adding options to the query string. For example:

```html
<iframe src="https://davidxmoody.com/wordsearch/?width=9&height=9&maxWords=20&word=these&word=will&word=be&word=the&word=words&word=you&word=find"></iframe>
```

Please feel free to give me any feedback or suggestions at <david@davidxmoody.com>
